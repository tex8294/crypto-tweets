# crypto-tweets

Machine learning project to analyze relationships between twitter activity and crypto-currency price movements
Written in python with use of keras, tensorflow, word2vec, twitter API, and different data visualization tools

This project is for an academic course offered as part of the UPC masters in photonics program by Peter Wittek of ICFO

the jupyter notebook has explanations and annotations of the various parts of code we used, but is not very functional because filepaths aren't really accounted for. 

To run the final program, run the "Binary sentprice" python file with the sentarray csv. The sentarray csv is the output of the text classification, python scraping, and bitcoin data collection. 

Our limited dataset really hampered us on this and we aren't really sure what to make of the results. We ran out of time to keep testing better classifiers and pair the outputs with different analyzers, and we ended up with a confusing mess. So currently this project is still a learning/stumbling exercise to teach us the importance of good data and long timescales for training (especially when the only computers available are old laptops).
