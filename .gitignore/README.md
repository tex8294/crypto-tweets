# crypto-tweets

Machine learning project to analyze relationships between twitter activity and crypto-currency price movements
Written in python with use of keras, tensorflow, word2vec, twitter API, and different data visualization tools

This project is for an academic course offered as part of the UPC masters in photonics program by Peter Wittek of ICFO

the jupyter notebook has explanations and annotations of the various parts of code we used, but is not very functional because filepaths aren't really accounted for. 

To run the final program, run the "kingcnn" python file with the sentarray csv. The sentarray csv is the output of the text classification, python scarping, and bitcoin data collection.
